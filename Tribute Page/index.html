        <li><span><b>1995: </b></span>Steven Paul Jobs February 24, 1955</li>
        <li><span><b>1972: </b></span>He attended Reed College in 1972 before dropping out that same year, and traveled through India in 1974 seeking enlightenment and studying Zen Buddhism.</li>
        <li><span><b>1976: </b></span>Jobs and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer.</li>
        <li><span><b>1979: </b></span>Together the duo gained fame and wealth a year later for the Apple II, one of the first highly successful mass-produced personal computers. Jobs saw the commercial potential of the Xerox Alto in 1979, which was mouse-driven
          and had a graphical user interface (GUI).</li>
        <li><span><b>1983-1984: </b></span>This led to development of the unsuccessful Apple Lisa in 1983, followed by the breakthrough Macintosh in 1984, the first mass-produced computer with a GUI</li>
        <li><span><b>1997: </b></span>Apple merged with NeXT in 1997, and Jobs became CEO of his former company within a few months. He was largely responsible for helping revive Apple, which had been at the verge of bankruptcy.</li>
